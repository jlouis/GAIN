* Carry out testing of the k-means code
   We now have some kmeans code, and a decent code coverage of the
   system. From here, we need to run more tests to make sure it works
   as intended.

* K-means cluster initialization needs some TLC
   Our code is often cycling since a cluster is never hit by any
   element. We ought to make a permanent fix to this problem as it is
   very often it cycles infinitely. At the moment we just start over
   and over. Convergence is very fast as soon as we hit all
   clusters. Methods for solving this is needed.

* Move the sparse vector code into an 'svec' module
   The kmeans code has spawned quite some vector processing code. It
   would be smart to move this into its own module so we can reap the
   benefits in other modules as well.

* Look into implmenting canopy clustering
   Canopy clustering looks quite simple to implement. We should write
   an implementation of this.
