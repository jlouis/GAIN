* Carry out testing of the k-means code
   We now have some kmeans code, and a decent code coverage of the
   system. From here, we need to run more tests to make sure it works
   as intended.

* Kmeans clustering have some obvious errors currently:

   This error is because we are calling zip with an empty list as one
   of the parameters. We should fix this problem.

   This looks wrong as well. The 5 clusters are not at all
   full-dimensional, and we should check out why. The code around
   kmeans iteration could do with some help and review.

* Look into implmenting canopy clustering
   Canopy clustering looks quite simple to implement. We should write
   an implementation of this.
